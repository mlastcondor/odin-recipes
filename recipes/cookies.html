        <h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
        <h4>For 12 Cookies</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>100g granulated sugar</li>
            <li>165g brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>115g melted butter</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>155g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>220g chocholate chunks</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Steps</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>preheat oven to 180 C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough onto the parchment paper, leaving at least 4 inches of space between cookies and 2 inches of space from the edge of the pan. They will spread!</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
            <li>Cool completely before serving</li>
