        <h2>The very best toad in the hole</h2>
        <p>This is by far the best toad in the hole I have ever made and this recipe is very easy to follow.</p>
        <p>If, like me, you love a well risen yorkshire, <em>you</em> will <strong>love</strong> this toad in the hole for sure.</p>
        <h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
        <h4>Serves 4</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>12 sausages</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sunflower oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the batter</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>140g plain flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>175ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Steps</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 200C. Put the sausages in a roasting tin with the oil and bake for 15 mins until browned</li>
            <li>Make the batter. Tip the flour into a bowl with 1/2 tsp salt, make a well in the middle and crack the eggs into it. Use a whisk to mix it together, then slowly add the milk, whisking all the tim. Leave to stand until the sausages are done.</li>
            <li>Remove the sausages from the oven - be careful because the fat will be sizzling hot - if it isn't, put the tin on the hob for a few minutes until it is.</li>
            <li>Pour in the batter mix, transfer to the top shelf of the oven, then cook for 25-30 mins, until risen and golden. Serve with gravy and your favourite veg.</li>
