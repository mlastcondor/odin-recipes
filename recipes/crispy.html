        <h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
        <h4>For the base and caramel</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>125g butter</li>
            <li>125g dark brown soft sugar</li>
            <li>397g carnation condensed milk</li>
            <li>100g rice cereal</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the topping</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>150g dark or milk chocolate</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Steps</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the sugar and butter in a non-stick pan gently, stirring, until melted. Add the condensed milk and bring to a rapid boil, stirring continuously.</li>
            <li>Cook the caramel for a minute or so until the filling has thickened.</li>
            <li>Put one third of the caramel into a large bowl and mix in the rice cereal. Press the mixture into the base of the tin and chill until set (about 15 minutes). Reserve the caramel.</li>
            <li>Pour the remaining caramel over the base. Cool, then chill until set.</li>
            <li>Place the chocolate into a bowl and microwave gently in short 10-20 second bursts until melted, stirring occasionally. Once melted, spread over the caramel for the topping, then chill until set.</li>
            <li>Remove from the tin, cut into squares and enjoy!</li>
